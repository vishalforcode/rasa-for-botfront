## When to Deploy Your Assistant

The best time to deploy your assistant and make it available to test users is once it can handle the most
important happy paths or is what we call a [minimum viable assistant](../glossary.mdx). Then you can use incoming
conversations to inform further development of your assistant.

Connecting your deployed assistant to Rasa X makes it easy to share your assistant
with test users via the [share your assistant feature in
Rasa X](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/user-guide/share-assistant#share-your-bot).
Then, when you're ready to make your assistant available via one or more [Messaging and Voice Channels](../messaging-and-voice-channels.mdx),
you can add them to your existing deployment set up.
See the [Rasa X Installation Guide](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/installation-and-setup/installation-guide/) to learn how to deploy Rasa X and connect it to your Rasa Open Source deployment.


## Recommended Deployment Method
The [Rasa Helm chart](https://github.com/RasaHQ/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/rasa) is the production ready method to deploy
your assistant on a Kubernetes or Openshift cluster. For details, see the [deployment instructions](./deploy-rasa.mdx).

### Cluster Requirements

To install the Rasa Helm chart, you need an existing
[Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/) or [OpenShift cluster](https://www.openshift.com/).
If you don't have one yet, you can get a managed cluster from a cloud provider like:
* [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine),
* [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/),
* [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/), or
* [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/).

If you are looking for a lightweight, non-production cluster that can run on a single machine, check out the instructions for using [Rasa Ephemeral Installer (REI)](../deploy/rei/deploy.mdx). REI will help you set up a local Kubernetes cluster on which you can deploy your assistant using the Rasa Helm chart.

## Alternative Deployment Methods

The following deployment methods are not suited to a production deployment, but can be useful for development and testing:

* [Running an assistant locally on the command line](../command-line-interface.mdx#rasa-run)

* [Developing an assistant in a Docker container](../docker/building-in-docker.mdx)

* [Deploying an assistant with Docker Compose](../docker/deploying-in-docker-compose.mdx)
