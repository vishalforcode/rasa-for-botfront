Are you unfamiliar with Docker, Kubernetes and Helm? Check out "[Understanding Rasa Deployments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAs_RS0ueEw&list=PL75e0qA87dlHmfmu7oPPYA22fmc6GJ2aW)" on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ0V6493mLvqdiVwOKWBODQ).
:::

If you would like to deploy Rasa Assistant using the [Rasa OSS Helm chart](https://github.com/RasaHQ/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/rasa) on your machine,
you can use Rasa Ephemeral Installer which installs all tools and creates a local Kubernetes cluster that allows you to use the [Rasa OSS Helm chart](https://github.com/RasaHQ/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/rasa).

We recommend this method as an alternative to docker-compose.

## Create a local Kubernetes cluster via REI

The Rasa Ephemeral Install installs the following tools and creates a local Kubernetes cluster using `kind`.

Tools installed by [REI](https://github.com/RasaHQ/REI):

- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/)
- [helm](https://helm.sh/)
- [rasactl](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasactl)

1. Simply execute the following command.

  ```text
  curl -O https://rei.rasa.com/rei.sh && bash rei.sh -y
  ```

  After a few minutes, all components should be installed and a local Kubernetes cluster created.

  :::tip

  You can use the `kubectl cluster-info` to verify if all is good.

  :::

## Deploy Rasa Open Source Assistant

1. Add the Rasa Helm chart repository to helm.

  ```text
  helm repo add rasa https://helm.rasa.com
  helm repo update
  ```

2. Deploy Rasa Open Source server by using the rasa helm chart.

  ```text
  helm install --namespace <NAMESPACE> <RELEASE_NAME> rasa/rasa
  ```

  For example:

  ```text
  helm install --namespace rasa-oss rasa rasa/rasa
  ```

  :::tip
  If a namespace that you'd like to use doesn't exist you can use the `--create-namespace` to create it.
  :::

## Access Rasa Open Source Assistant

By default the Rasa deployment is exposed via the `rasa` (`<release name>`) service and accessible only within a Kubernetes cluster. You can get the IP address using this command:

```text
export SERVICE_PORT=$(kubectl get --namespace <your namespace> \
  -o jsonpath="{.spec.ports[0].port}" services <release name>)

kubectl port-forward --namespace <your namespace> \
  svc/<release name> ${SERVICE_PORT}:${SERVICE_PORT} &
```

### Accessing Assistant from your local machine

The example above describe how to access Rasa Open Source Assistant by using `kubectl port-forward`. The other option is to expose your deployment
on `NodePort` and access it directly.

1. Prepare configuration that switch the rasa service to `NodePort`.

  ```yaml
  # rasa-values.yaml
  service:
    type: "NodePort"
  ```

2. Upgrade deployment.

  ```text
  helm upgrade --namespace <NAMESPACE> --reuse-values -f rasa-values.yaml <RELEASE NAME> rasa/rasa
  ```

3. Get the node port and address for the rasa service

  ```text
  export NODE_PORT=$(kubectl get --namespace <NAMESPACE> -o jsonpath="{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}" services <RELEASE NAME>)

  $ curl http://127.0.0.1:${NODE_PORT}
  Hello from Rasa: 2.8.7
  ```

## Configuration

Prepare an empty file called `rasa-values.yaml` which will include all your custom
configuration for the installation with Helm.

All available values and more examples you can find in [the Rasa helm chart repository](https://github.com/RasaHQ/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/rasa#values).

:::note
The default configuration of the Rasa chart deploys a Rasa Open Source Server, downloads a model, and serves the downloaded model.
Visit [the Rasa helm chart repository](https://github.com/RasaHQ/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/rasa#quick-start) to check out more examples of configuration.

:::

### Loading an initial model

The first time you install Rasa, you may not have a model server available yet, or you may want an lightweight model for testing the deployment.
For this purpose, you can choose between training or downloading an initial model. By default, the Rasa chart downloads an example model from GitHub.
To use this option, you don't have to change anything.

If you want to define an existing model to download from a URL you define instead, update your `rasa-values.yaml` with the URL according to the following configuration:

  ```yaml
  # rasa-values.yaml
  applicationSettings:
    initialModel: "https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-x-demo/blob/master/models/model.tar.gz?raw=true"
  ```
:::note
The URL for the initial model download has to point to a tar.gz file and must not require authentication.

:::

Apply changes by executing the command:

```text
helm upgrade --reuse-values -f rasa-values.yaml \
  --namespace <NAMESPACE> <RELEASE_NAME> rasa/rasa
```

In [the rasa helm chart repository](https://github.com/RasaHQ/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/rasa) you can find more [options for loading models](https://github.com/RasaHQ/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/rasa#options-for-loading-models).

### Configuring Channels

You can enable messaging channels by specifying credentials in `rasa-values.yaml` in the same way you would define them in `credentials.yml` when running locally.

For example, to enable the REST channel, update your rasa-values.yaml file with the following channel configuration:

```yaml
# rasa-values.yaml
applicationSettings:
  # (...)
  credentials:
    # (...)
    additionalChannelCredentials:
      rest:
```

:::note
For the rest channel, no credentials are required. To learn more see: https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/connectors/your-own-website)
